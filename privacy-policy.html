        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the applications developed by Kavin Thangavel(Kxvin)! This privacy policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your personal information across all applications, including websites, mobile apps, and browser extensions. By using any of our applications, you consent to the data practices described in this policy.</p>

        <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>We do not collect personally identifiable information (PII) unless explicitly stated in the specific application. Some applications may require access to certain permissions like storage or network requests to provide functionality (e.g., displaying motivational quotes, fetching images, etc.). The data collected is generally limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Basic interaction data like clicks, preferences, and settings for the purpose of improving the user experience.</li>
            <li>Non-personally identifiable information collected via third-party APIs used to fetch public data (e.g., quotes, images).</li>
            <li>Device-related information such as IP address, device type, and operating system version for error tracking and troubleshooting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Some of our applications use third-party services to enhance user experience. These services may collect information used to identify you. The third-party services include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>API Services</strong>: We may use external APIs (such as Unsplash for images, Quotable for quotes, etc.) to fetch content. These APIs do not collect personally identifiable information, but they may gather non-personally identifiable data.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics</strong>: We may use analytics services like Google Analytics or other similar services to track user activity within the app. This helps us understand how the application is used and where we can improve.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Usage</h2>
        <p>The data collected through the apps is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide you with the features of the application (e.g., motivational quotes, images, etc.).</li>
            <li>To enhance user experience by making the application more efficient, fast, and relevant to your preferences.</li>
            <li>For troubleshooting, debugging, and improving the quality of the applications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p>We do not use cookies or any form of tracking technologies in most of our applications. However, if certain applications do use cookies or other tracking mechanisms, this will be clearly stated within the application.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable precautions to protect the information we collect. However, please note that no method of electronic transmission is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. When we update the policy, we will post the changes on this page, and the revised policy will apply to all applications moving forward. Please review this page periodically for any updates.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to access, update, or delete the data we collect. If you have any concerns about the data we collect or wish to exercise your rights, please contact us at the email address provided below.</p>
